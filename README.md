# Responsive Grid w/ YouTube video

I'm trying to use CSS grid to create a responsive layout that splits the screen into two columns i.e. two thirds (left) and one third (right).

The left columns -- taking up 2/3 of screen -- should have an embedded YouTube video that takes up all the available space in that column i.e. scaling up and down nicely.

The right column will have the company logo as well as some message.

When viewed on a smaller screen, columns should stack up: left column on top of the right one. Both video and the logo image should also scale down but continue to use all the available space.
